I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. David Z. Pan and I am actively seeking full-time software engineering positions.

My current research interests include machine learning and computer-aided design for VLSI. I have interned at Cadence and Nvidia.
